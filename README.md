LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. It takes 4 different commands and gives back very useful data to its user.

The commands are:

my-tweets -> LIRI dispays the latest 20 tweets from the chosen Twitter account

spotify-this-song <type song> -> LIRI displays information about the chosen song.

movie-this <type movie> -> LIRI dispays information about the chosen movie.

do-what-it-says -> LIRI reads the file random.txt and does as it says!

I hope you have as much fun using LIRI as I had programming it!
